00:01.00 --> 00:004.000 
<c.1>We observe today</c>
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
<c.2>not a victory of a party,</c>
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
<c.3>but a celebration of freedom-</c>
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
<c.4>symbolizing an end,</c>
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
<c.5>as well as a beginning-</c>
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
<c.6>signifying renewal,</c>
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
<c.7>as well as change.</c>
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
<c.8>For I have sworn before you</c>
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
<c.9>and Almighty God</c>
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
<c.10>the same solemn oath</c>
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
<c.11>our forebears perscribed</c>
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
<c.12>nearly a century and three-quarters ago.</c>
